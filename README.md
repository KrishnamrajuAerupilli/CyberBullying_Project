# Cyberbullying Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a web-based application that detects cyberbullying in text using machine learning techniques. The aim is to support online safety and digital well-being by providing real-time classification of harmful content.


##  Features

-  Machine Learning Model ('Passive Aggressive', 'XGBoost', 'Random Forest', 'Multinomial Naive Bayes')
-  Text classification: Detects whether a message is cyberbullying or not
-  Real-time inference through a clean and interactive Streamlit web app
-  Preprocessing using NLP techniques: Tokenization, Stopwords Removal, TF-IDF
-  Easily extendable for other text classification tasks

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit – for web UI
- Scikit-learn – for ML model training and inference
- NLTK – for text preprocessing
- Pandas, NumPy – for data handling
- Jupyter Notebook – for model training
